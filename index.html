      <p>
        Hello my name is DeVin, I live with my wife and two kids in Santaquin
        Utah. I work as the Director of Application Development for a medical
        coding company and have been there for 5 years now. My family and I
        enjoy the outdoors, we love going on RZR rides, hikes, camping and more.
        During the summer my family tags along with me for my main hobby of
        classic car restoration as I take some of our classic cars to car shows
        around Utah.
