        Hello my name is DeVin if you couldnt already tell from the title at the
        top of the page, I live with my wife Kendra and two kids, Parker and
        Abigail in Utah. I work as the Director of Application Development for
        the medical coding company Innovihealth and have been there for 5 years
        now. My family and I enjoy the outdoors, we love going on RZR rides,
        hikes, camping and more. During the summer my family tags along with me
        for my main hobby of classic car restoration as I take some of our
        classic cars to car shows around Utah County.
